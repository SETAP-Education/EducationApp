# Education App 

## Project Structure

The root directory does not contain the flutter project. It contains files. *Such as this*. That describe the project. the flutter project itself can be found within `education_app/`. 

## Building and Running

First Clone the Repository  
```
git clone https://github.com/SETAP-Education/EducationApp.git
```

Next cd into the repository file and also the flutter project directory.  
```
cd EducationApp
cd education_app
```

The next step is to build for web. We will use Chrome but this can be done using other web browsers that are up to date. 

```
flutter run -d chrome
```
This will run the project in debug mode. 

## Pulling Main to your branch

```
git checkout BRANCH_NAME
```
```
git pull origin main
```

## Committing to your Branch

This will create a commit and push it to the remote reposity. 

This adds all the changed files to the commit. 
```
git add . 
```
```
git commit -m "MESSAGE"
```
The commit has been committed locally. The next command will push it to the remote repo. 
```
git push
```
When you've made all your changes you go to github and create a pull request.
