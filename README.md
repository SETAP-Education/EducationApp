# Quizzical - An education application

## Project Description

Quizzical is a web-based quiz app programmed in Dart that uses a unique tagging system to recommend and produce quizzes. This project makes use of the Firebase API that remotely stores the database, authentication service as well as provides web hosting.

## Building and Running

Before running the application, please make sure you have the up to date versions of Dart and Flutter.

First Clone the Repository  
```
git clone https://github.com/SETAP-Education/EducationApp.git
```

Next cd into the repository file and also the flutter project directory.  
```
cd EducationApp
cd education_app
```

After accessing the project directory, navigate to ``pubspec.yaml`` and select "Pub get". You can also use
```
flutter pub get
```

The next step is to build for web. We will use Chrome but this can be done using other web browsers that are up to date. 

```
flutter run -d chrome
```
This will run the project in debug mode.
